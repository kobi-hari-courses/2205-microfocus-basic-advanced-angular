### Introduction to Reactive Forms
* We have seen how to start using angular reactive forms by incorporating `ReactiveFormsModule` 
* We have constructed instances of `FormControl` to manage specific fields
* We have connected the input elements to the managing `FormControl` using the `[FormControl]` directive
* We have grouped the form controls into a single `FormGroup` and used its method and properties to collectively manage all the form controls together
* We have used the css classes `ng-valid`, `ng-invalid`, `ng-touched`, `ng-dirty` to highlight invalid fields. 
* We have used the `valid` and `invalid` properties of the form group to control the ability to submit the data
* We have used the `.value` property to get the value of a form control, or a complete object.
* We have used the `.errors` property to present error information to the user
* We have seen how to create nested objects using a nested `FormGroup`
* We have seen how to create custom validators and custom async validators
