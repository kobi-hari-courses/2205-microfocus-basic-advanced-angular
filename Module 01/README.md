* We have seen the true meaning of the `new` and `this` keywords, and most specifically - that they do not have the same meaning as in Java.
* We have experienced the problem of the missing `this` context
* We learned about javascript scopes and **Closures**
* We learned about the `prototype` object and property
* We learned the difference between serverside javascript (**NodeJS**) and clientside web javascript
  * We talked about modularity and the `require` keyword
