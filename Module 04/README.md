## At the end of module 04 we will have:

### More Angular Directives
* We used `class.x` to conditionally add the class `x` according to a boolean value
* We used `style.x` to set a specific style property by binding
* We used them both to implement selection

### Custom components
* We saw how to create a component manually, and then used the generator to create them automatically
* We learned how to define inputs using the `@Input` decorator
* We saw how to populate inputs with values
* We saw how to use data binding to populate inputs
* We saw how to define output events uisng the `@Output` decorator
* We saw how to regiter to the events and respond to them
* We saw how to carry payload in the event, and consume it in the event handler

### lifecycle hooks

* We talked about several lifecycle hooks: 
    - `OnInit`
    - `OnDestroy`
