# Javascript

### Javascript types and gotchas
* We have Convered the 7 types of javascript: boolean, number, string, object, function, null and undefined
* We have seen how to use JSON to describe complex object values
* We have seen the true meaning of the `new` and `this` keywords, and most specifically - that they do not have the same meaning as in Java.
* We learned how to use the `prototype` to expose common functionality to all objects create by the same constructor
* We have experienced the problem of the missing `this` context
