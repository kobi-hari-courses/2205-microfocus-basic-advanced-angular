### About the various Javascript engines
* We reiterated that javascript can be executed either by NodeJS and by the browser
* We understood that there are differences in the features that the javascripts support
* We understood that "web" javascript allows us to use the `window` object and the `DOM` while NodeJS does not
* We understood that "nodeJS" javascript allows a javascript file to "require" another one thus allowing us to build a more modular project
* We understood that we therefore can enjor the benefits of npm to manage our projects
* We talked about the fact the in angular, we develop for nodeJS and then "compile" to to work on the web
* We said that one of the features required to allow that is the use of **Webpack** a utility that packs several dependent files into one javascript file.

### Typescript introduction
* How to declare a type for a variable
* Declaring function return type
* Defining arrays
* Defining Tuples
* Defining Narrowed Object types
* Defining function signature types
* Using the `let` keyword
* Defining Classes
* Declaring constructors and initializing fields in the constructor signature
* private, public and protected fields
* Using interfaces
* Typescript definition for **Type Safety** as "signature compatible"
* Union Types
* Cross Types
* the `type` alias

### How to use Node, Npm, and Tsc
* We have installed NodeJS from the website and run javascript files using node
* Npm was also installed
    * We have seen how the file `pakcage.json` helps to manage our project
    * We used npm to incorporate external JS packages into our project
    * We saw how to use npm to globally install javacript tools so we can execute them from anywhere
* We have created ts file and compiled it with TSC and run it with Node
* We saw how to use the file `tsconfig` to configure the typescript compiler
* We saw how to build **Modular** typescript projects by defining typescript modules
  * defining exportable identifiers using the `export` keyword
  * defining imported identifiers using the `import` keyword
